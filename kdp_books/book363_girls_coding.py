("Why Coding Matters for Girls","Role Model: Grace Hopper invented the first compiler and coined the term 'debugging.' She proved that women belong at the forefront of computer science. Today only 26% of computing jobs are held by women. You can change that.","Coding is not just about computers. It teaches logical thinking, creative problem-solving, persistence through debugging, and the power to build anything you can imagine. Girls who code become women who change the world.","Think of 3 apps you use daily. Someone CODED those. You could build the next one!"),
("What Programmers Actually Do","Role Model: Susan Wojcicki was the 16th Google employee and later ran YouTube. She saw problems and built solutions that billions of people use every day.","Programmers are problem-solvers who speak the language of computers. They build apps, design games, create websites, analyze data, make robots move, and even help doctors save lives. Programming is in EVERY industry.","List 10 things in your daily life that require code to work. You will be surprised how many there are!"),
("Thinking Like a Coder (Computational Thinking)","Role Model: Reshma Saujani founded Girls Who Code to close the gender gap in technology. She teaches millions of girls to think computationally.","Computational thinking has 4 parts: decomposition (breaking big problems into small ones), pattern recognition (finding similarities), abstraction (removing unnecessary details), and algorithm design (creating step-by-step solutions).","Practice decomposition: break 'clean your room' into the smallest possible steps. Write at least 15."),
("Algorithms in Everyday Life","Role Model: Fei-Fei Li is a leading AI researcher who created ImageNet, teaching computers to recognize images. Her algorithms power visual AI worldwide.","An algorithm is a set of step-by-step instructions to solve a problem. Your morning routine is an algorithm. A recipe is an algorithm. Getting dressed involves an algorithm (you would not put socks over shoes!).","Write an algorithm for making a peanut butter sandwich with EVERY step. Now follow it literally (computers cannot guess!)."),
("Loops and Patterns","Role Model: Megan Smith was the US Chief Technology Officer and VP at Google. She used pattern recognition to solve problems at massive scale.","Loops let computers repeat actions without rewriting code. Instead of writing 'draw star' 100 times, you write 'repeat 100 times: draw star.' Loops are everywhere: playlists on repeat, daily alarms, even seasons cycling.","Find 5 examples of loops in your real life. For each, write how many times it repeats and what the repeated action is."),
("If/Then Decisions","Role Model: Kimberly Bryant founded Black Girls CODE to increase diversity in tech by teaching coding to African-American girls ages 7-17.","Computers make decisions using IF/THEN logic: IF button pressed THEN play sound. IF password correct THEN open account. IF temperature below 32 THEN display frost warning. Every app is built on thousands of these decisions.","Write 10 IF/THEN rules for your daily life. Example: IF alarm rings THEN get out of bed. IF hungry THEN eat snack."),
("Variables and Data","Role Model: Radia Perlman invented the spanning tree protocol that makes the internet work. She is sometimes called the Mother of the Internet.","Variables are containers that hold information. Think of them as labeled boxes: playerName holds your name, score holds your points, livesLeft holds how many tries remain. Programs manipulate variables to create dynamic experiences.","Create variables for a game about yourself: myName, myAge, favoriteColor, highScore, level. Assign values to each."),
("Debugging (Finding and Fixing)","Role Model: Margaret Hamilton led the software team for NASA's Apollo missions. Her code (and debugging skills) helped land humans on the moon.","Bugs are errors in code. Debugging is detective work: finding where the code does something unexpected and fixing it. Every programmer spends more time debugging than writing new code. It is not failure - it is the job!","Find the bug: in the sequence 'put on socks, put on shoes, put on pants, walk outside' - what is wrong? How would you debug it?"),
("Simple Game Design","Role Model: Kim Swift designed Portal, one of the most celebrated video games ever. She started as a student and her thesis project became a hit game.","Games are built on: game loop (check input, update state, draw screen, repeat), win/lose conditions, player feedback (sounds, visuals), increasing difficulty, and reward systems. Every game from Tetris to Fortnite uses these elements.","Design a simple game on paper: What are the rules? How do you win? How does difficulty increase? What feedback does the player get?"),
("Web Basics (HTML/CSS Intro)","Role Model: Limor Fried founded Adafruit Industries, making open-source hardware and teaching millions to build electronics and code.","Websites are built with HTML (the structure/content) and CSS (the style/appearance). HTML uses tags like <h1> for headings and <p> for paragraphs. CSS changes colors, fonts, sizes, and layouts. Together they create everything you see online.","Draw a webpage design on paper. Label which parts are HTML structure and which are CSS styling (colors, fonts, positions)."),
("App Thinking","Role Model: Whitney Wolfe Herd created Bumble, an app that empowered women to make the first move. She identified a problem and coded a solution.","App development starts with a problem: What frustration do people have? Then: How can technology solve it? Great apps are simple, solve one problem well, and are delightful to use. You can design an app before knowing how to code it!","Identify a problem in your daily life. Design an app to solve it: name it, sketch 5 screens, explain how it works."),
("AI Basics","Role Model: Timnit Gebru is a leading AI ethics researcher who works to ensure artificial intelligence is fair and does not discriminate against women and minorities.","Artificial Intelligence means teaching computers to learn from data instead of following rigid rules. AI recognizes faces in photos, suggests songs you might like, translates languages, and drives cars. It learns from examples like you learn from experience.","Think about AI you interact with daily (Siri, recommendations, filters). How does it know what you want? What data does it learn from?"),
("Women in Tech (Role Models)","Across tech history, women have been pioneers: Ada Lovelace (first programmer), Grace Hopper (compiler inventor), Hedy Lamarr (WiFi predecessor), Katherine Johnson (NASA calculations), and today's leaders at every major tech company.","Women in tech face unique challenges: being outnumbered, imposter syndrome, bias in hiring. But the women who persist change the world. The tech industry NEEDS your perspective, creativity, and problem-solving approach.","Research one woman in tech who inspires you. What specifically about her career path interests you?"),
("Coding Careers","The tech industry offers incredible career diversity: game developer, cybersecurity analyst, data scientist, web developer, AI researcher, robotics engineer, UX designer, app developer, tech entrepreneur, and many more.","Coding careers offer: high salaries, flexible schedules, remote work options, creative problem-solving, constant learning, and the ability to build things that millions of people use. Starting to learn NOW gives you years of advantage.","Choose 3 coding careers that interest you. Research: what do they do daily? What do they earn? What skills are needed?"),
("Your Coding Journey Starts Now","This is not the end - it is the beginning. You now understand how coders think and what programming can do. The next step is to actually start coding! Free resources abound: Scratch, Code.org, Khan Academy, freeCodeCamp, and more.","Your 30-day coding challenge: Week 1 - Complete a Scratch project. Week 2 - Try HTML/CSS on freeCodeCamp. Week 3 - Solve puzzles on Code.org. Week 4 - Start learning Python basics. Track your progress and celebrate milestones!","Set up your coding environment today. Choose one free platform and complete your first lesson. You are officially a coder!")]
